This scrapes the craigslist house and apartment rental listings. Please keep in mind this is a work in progress.

I intend to make make this into something that will scrape every page, not just the first, and return the result as a pandas dataframe.

For your own use, find the craigslist you would like to scrape. The url should look like example.craigslist.org. Paste the equivalent of "example" into the empty string that is assigned to craig_prefix, and it should work.

Thank you for looking!
