# README

This scrapes the craigslist house and apartment rental listings. Please keep in mind this is a work in progress.

This function returns a pandas dataframe of information that can be found about a rental from the https://example.craigslist.org/d/apts-housing-for-rent/search/apa page. Some information from this page is missing, such as number of bathrooms.

For your own use, find the craigslist you would like to scrape. The url should look like the link above. The function input should be the craigslist of choice that would replace 'example' in the link above.

Thank you for looking!
